In this sections you'll find the associated `mllibs` modules for different stages of a machine learning project

## Typical Steps in a Machine Learning Project:

### 1. Problem Definition

In this phase, we define the problem that we want to solve & determine the goals of the project

### 2. Data Collection

During this phase of the project, we gather the relevant data that will be used to train & test the model


### 3. Data Preprocessing

During this phase, we conduct various data preprocessing procedures that will make it suitable for data analysis


### 4. Data Exploration

During this phase of the project, we explore our dataset using various statistical and visualisation analysis techniques in order to gain some insight into our data


### 5. Feature Engineering

During this phase, we select relevant features that will be used as input into our model or create some additional features in the process


### 6. Model Selection

During this phase of the project, we select the relevant machine learning models that will be used in the project


### 7. Model Training

During this phase of the project, we train the model on the data that we prepared


### 8. Model Evaluation

During this phase, we evaluate the performance of the trained model using the desired evaluation metrics


### 9. Hyperparameter Optimisation

During this phase of the project, we optimise the parameters of the model in order to improve the model perform

### 10. Deployment

The final phase of the project involves saving the model for use on new data
